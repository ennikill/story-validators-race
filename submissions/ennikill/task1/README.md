# My name is eniikill. 
I am a computer engineer, a programmer and because of my passion for Blockchain and technology, I have been a full-time Node runner for 5 months. I am always looking for new ways to optimize performance and provide optimal solutions for each problem to maximize node performance. Currently I have available Infrastructure CPU AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 9 7950X3D, Ram 128 GB DDR5 ECC, Disk Size 3.84 TB NVMe SSD (Gen4), Bandwidth 1 Gbit/s to easily meet the higher demands of Hardware Requirement.
